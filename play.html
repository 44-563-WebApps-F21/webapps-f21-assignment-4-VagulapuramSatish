            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MRS. ALLONBY.</i> </h6>
            <p class="speech allonby">What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a
            little! </p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LADY STUTFIELD.</i> </h6>  
            <p class="speech stutfield">Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they? </p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MRS. ALLONBY.</i> </h6>  
            <p class="speech allonby">Persecute us?  I wish they did.</p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LADY HUNSTANTON.</i> </h6>  
            <p class="speech hunstanton">My dear!</p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MRS. ALLONBY.</i> </h6>
            <p class="speech allonby">The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly
            happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to
            leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
            space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be
            absolutely worn to shadows.</p>
            
            [_Enter Servants with coffee_.]
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LADY HUNSTANTON.</i> </h6> 
            <p class="speech hunstanton">Worn to shadows, dear?</p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MRS. ALLONBY.</i> </h6> 
            <p class="speech allonby">Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up
            to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.</p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LADY STUTFIELD.</i> </h6>
            <p class="speech stutfield">It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
            escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their
            power and use it.</p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LADY CAROLINE.</i> </h6> 
            <p class="speech caroline">[_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  What stuff and nonsense
            all this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper
            place.</p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MRS. ALLONBY.</i> </h6>  
            <p class="speech allonby">But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?</p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LADY CAROLINE.</i> </h6> 
            <p class="speech caroline">Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.</p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MRS. ALLONBY.</i> </h6> 
            <p class="speech allonby">[_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  Really?  And if they’re
            not married?</p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LADY CAROLINE.</i> </h6> 
            <p class="speech caroline">If they are not married, they should be looking after a
            wife.  It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going
            about society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry
            within twelve months.</p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LADY STUTFIELD.</i> </h6>  
            <p class="speech stutfield">[_Refuses coffee_.]  But if they’re in love with some
            one who, perhaps, is tied to another?</p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LADY CAROLINE.</i> </h6> 
            <p class="speech caroline">In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off
            in a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to
            meddle with other people’s property.</p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MRS. ALLONBY.</i> </h6> 
            <p class="speech allonby">I don’t think that we should ever be spoken of as other
            people’s property.  All men are married women’s property.  That is the
            only true definition of what married women’s property really is.  But we
            don’t belong to any one.</p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LADY STUTFIELD.</i> </h6> 
            <p class="speech stutfield">Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so.</p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LADY HUNSTANTON.</i> </h6> 
            <p class="speech hunstanton">But do you really think, dear Caroline, that
            legislation would improve matters in any way?  I am told that, nowadays,
            all the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like
            married men.</p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MRS. ALLONBY</i>. </h6> 
            <p class="speech allonby">I certainly never know one from the other.</p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LADY STUTFIELD</i>. </h6>
            <p class="speech stutfield">Oh, I think one can always know at once whether a man
            has home claims upon his life or not.  I have noticed a very, very sad
            expression in the eyes of so many married men.</p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MRS. ALLONBY</i>. </h6> 
            <p class="speech allonby">Ah, all that I have noticed is that they are horribly
            tedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they
            are not.</p>
            
            <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LADY HUNSTANTON</i>. </h6> 
            <p class="speech hunstanton">Well, I suppose the type of husband has completely
            changed since my young days, but I’m bound to state that poor dear
            Hunstanton was the most delightful of creatures, and as good as gold.</p>
