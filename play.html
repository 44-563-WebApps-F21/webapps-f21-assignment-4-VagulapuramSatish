            Act II
            SCENE

            _Drawing-room at Hunstanton_, _after dinner_, _lamps lit_.  _Door_ L.C.
                                          _Door_ R.C.
        </h5>

        <p>
            MRS. ALLONBY.  What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a
            little! <br>
            
            LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they? <br>
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  Persecute us?  I wish they did.<br>
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!<br>
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly
            happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to
            leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
            space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be
            absolutely worn to shadows.<br>
            
            [_Enter Servants with coffee_.]
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  Worn to shadows, dear?<br>
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up
            to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.<br>
            
            LADY STUTFIELD.  It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
            escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their
            power and use it.<br>
            
            LADY CAROLINE.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  What stuff and nonsense
            all this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper
            place.<br>
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?<br>
            
            LADY CAROLINE.  Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.<br>
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  Really?  And if they’re
            not married?<br>
            
            LADY CAROLINE.  If they are not married, they should be looking after a
            wife.  It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going
            about society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry
            within twelve months.<br>
            
            LADY STUTFIELD.  [_Refuses coffee_.]  But if they’re in love with some
            one who, perhaps, is tied to another?<br>
            
            LADY CAROLINE.  In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off
            in a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to
            meddle with other people’s property.<br>
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  I don’t think that we should ever be spoken of as other
            people’s property.  All men are married women’s property.  That is the
            only true definition of what married women’s property really is.  But we
            don’t belong to any one.<br>
            
            LADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so.<br>
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you really think, dear Caroline, that
            legislation would improve matters in any way?  I am told that, nowadays,
            all the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like
            married men.<br>
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  I certainly never know one from the other.<br>
            
            LADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I think one can always know at once whether a man
            has home claims upon his life or not.  I have noticed a very, very sad
            expression in the eyes of so many married men.<br>
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, all that I have noticed is that they are horribly
            tedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they
            are not.<br>
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, I suppose the type of husband has completely
            changed since my young days, but I’m bound to state that poor dear
            Hunstanton was the most delightful of creatures, and as good as gold.<br>
